My TypeScript Learning Journey
==============================

This repository documents my journey learning TypeScript. I am using this repository to keep track of the concepts I learn, the projects I create, and the resources I use.

Why TypeScript?
---------------

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. I decided to learn TypeScript because:

-   It can help catch errors before runtime
-   It makes code more maintainable and easier to read
-   It's widely used in the industry, especially with frameworks like React and Angular

Projects
--------

I will be creating various projects using TypeScript to apply the concepts I learn. Here are some of the projects I plan to work on:

-   A simple todo app using React and TypeScript
-   A calculator app using TypeScript classes and interfaces
-   A node.js server using TypeScript and Express

Resources
---------

I will be using various resources to learn TypeScript. Here are some of the resources I plan to use:

-   [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
-   [TypeScript course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-the-complete-developers-guide/)
-   [TypeScript tutorial on FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-definitive-typescript-handbook/)
-   [React with TypeScript tutorial on official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/typescript.html)

Contributions
-------------

Feel free to contribute to this repository by adding more projects or resources. Please make sure that any contributions align with the purpose of this repository.

Conclusion
----------

I am excited to start this TypeScript learning journey and look forward to the projects I will create and the knowledge I will gain.
